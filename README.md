# CrackMate

CrackMate is a modern, AI-powered coding and interview assistant built with Electron and React. It helps you practice coding and aptitude questions, analyze screenshots, upload your resume for personalized interview prep, and interact with AI using your voiceâ€”all in a beautiful, desktop-friendly UI.

## Features

- **Voice Assistant:** Start/stop listening and ask coding or aptitude questions by voice. AI only responds when you ask a question.
- **Screenshot Solving:** Take a screenshot of any coding or aptitude problem (even with a solution), and CrackMate will extract, analyze, and provide:
  - For coding: Approach, Solution (with code/comments), Complexity (time/space, as bullets), or Comparison if a solution is present.
  - For aptitude: Correct answer and a short explanation.
- **Resume Upload:** Upload your PDF/DOCX resume. The AI will use your background to personalize interview answers.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Quickly take screenshots, move the window, start over, toggle visibility, and more.
- **Beautiful UI:** Modern, responsive, and distraction-free design with dynamic content areas and code blocks.
- **No unnecessary file saving:** Screenshots are processed in-memory for privacy and speed.
